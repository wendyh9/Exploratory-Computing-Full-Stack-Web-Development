                    Malaysia is a Southeast Asian country that consists of two regions separated by the South China Sea. 
                    These two separate areas of land are known as Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia. Malaysia's 
                    capital, Kuala Lumpur, is located on the west side of Peninusular Malaysia. The population is around 
                    32.4 million people. The currency in Malaysia is called Ringgit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Located near the equator, Malaysia has a tropical climate with high temperatures and high levels of 
                    humidity. This allows many tropical fruits to thrive. Durian, lychee, coconut, and rambutan are a few 
                    examples of tropical fruits that are commonly grown there.

                <p>
                    The Malaysian population is made up of a variety of ethnic groups. A little over 60% of the population 
                    are Bumiputra, which are Malays and indigenous peoples. Chinese people are the second largest ethic group 
                    at around 20%. Around 6.3% of the population are Indian people. The remaining 11.3% of the population are 
                    other ethnic groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The three main Malaysian languages are Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. The Goverment of Malaysia recognized 
                    the importance of English as an international language and have taken measures to ensure that it would be 
                    taught as a strong second language.
